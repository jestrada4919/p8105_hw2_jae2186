## Problem 1

The following code chunk uploads the publicly available data of
Mr. Trashwheel from May 2014 through June 2019 in an Excel spreadsheet
format.

The following changes have been made to the dataset:

-   non-data entries are omitted (i.e. rows with notes/figures and
    columns containing notes),
-   reasonable variable names have been applied,
-   rows that do not include dumpster-specific data are omitted, and
-   the number of `sports_balls` is rounded to the nearest integer.

``` r
trash_wheel <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(volume_cu_yds = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```
