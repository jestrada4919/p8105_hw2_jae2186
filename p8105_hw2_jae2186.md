## Problem 1

The following code chunk uploads the publicly available data of
Mr. Trashwheel from May 2014 through January 2021 in an Excel
spreadsheet format.

The following changes have been made to the dataset:

-   non-data entries are omitted (i.e. rows with notes/figures and
    columns containing notes),
-   reasonable variable names have been applied,
-   rows that do not include dumpster-specific data are omitted, and
-   the number of `sports_balls` is rounded to the nearest integer.

``` r
trash_wheel <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:N535") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(volume_cu_yds = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) 
```

The following code chunk reads, cleans, and combines precipitation data
availble for 2018 and 2019.

``` r
precip2019 <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:B14",
                    sheet = 6)  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(precip_in = total) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.name[month], year = "2019") %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip2018 <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:B14",
                    sheet = 5)  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(precip_in = total) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.name[month], year = "2018") %>% 
  relocate(year)

all_precip <- bind_rows(precip2018, precip2019)
```

The dataset first presented describes the trash collected by
Mr. Trashwheel from mid-May 2014 through January 2021, taking in 453
dumpsters with an average of 3.2002208 tons of trash per dumpster,
ultimately collecting a total of 1449.7 tons of trash over the course of
these years.

Some quick statistics on the weather conditions and trash collected:

-   <b>Precipitation</b>: Total precipitation in 2018 was 56.75 inches.
    For 2019 precipitation was 33.95 inches. A total of 90.7 inches of
    precipitation fell over the 2-year observation period noted here.

-   <b>Plastic bottles</b>: There were a over 0.86 million plastic
    bottles collected with a mean of 1899 plastic bottles per dumpster.

-   <b>Glass bottles</b>: Comparatively there were only a total of 10171
    glass bottles collected with a mean of 22.45 glass bottles per
    dumpster.

-   <b> Sports balls</b>: Per dumpster there were an average of 11.75
    sports balls collected by Mr. Trashwheel during this time. When
    broken down by years:

    -   In 2014 there were an average of 6.05 sports balls collected
        (median of 6 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 17.44 sports balls collected
        (median of 16 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 25.67 sports balls collected
        (median of 26 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 9.64 sports balls collected
        (median of 8 sports balls),
    -   In 2018 there were an average of 4.82 sports balls collected
        (median of 4 sports balls),
    -   <b>In 2019 there were an average of 10.03 sports balls collected
        (median of 9 sports balls),</b>
    -   And in 2020 there were an average of 11.89 sports balls
        collected (median of 12 sports balls),

## Problem 2

Using the data from FiveThirtyEight looking at political party and
economics measures,

``` r
pols_month <-
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  mutate(year = 0, month = 0, day = 0) %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), month = month.name[month], 
         year = as.numeric(year),
         prez = ifelse (prez_gop > 0, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, prez)
```

``` r
snp <- read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, c('month', 'day', 'year'), '/') %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year), 
         month = as.numeric(month),
         month = month.name[month],
         year = ifelse(year < 50, year + 2000, year + 1900)) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

``` r
unemploy <-
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  rename(year = Year, 
         January = Jan, February = Feb, 
         March = Mar, April = Apr,
         May = May, June = Jun, 
         July = Jul, August = Aug, 
         September = Sep, October = Oct, 
         November = Nov, December = Dec) %>% 
  pivot_longer(January:December) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  rename(month = name) %>% 
  arrange(year)
```

``` r
pol_unemploy <- 
  left_join(pols_month, snp) %>% 
  left_join(unemploy)
```

The first dataset entitled `pols_month` provided detailed information on
the political party affiliation with regards to political leaders in
various branches of government within the United States. The data
provided the breakdown of political affiliation (i.e. either republican
party noted as ‘gop’ or democratic party noted as ‘dem’) for the
president as well as giving total counts for the number of senators
(`sen_gop` or `sen_dem`), governors (`gov_gop` or `gov_dem`), and house
representatives (`rep_gop` or `rep_dem`) affiliated with each party. The
data provided monthly information on this political party breakdown,
covering 822 months, starting in January 1947 and going until June 2015.

The second data set then provided dates and closing values for the
Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S&P) with 787 monthly values
(taken on the 15th of each month) that started in July 1950 and going
until January 2015.

The third dataset provided the monthly rates of umemployment, covering
816 months of data, starting in January 1948 and going until December
2015.

## Problem 3

The following produces a table of the rank of popularity of the name
“Olivia” over time as taken from the NYC Open data on the popularity of
baby names.

``` r
replace_eth <- 
  tibble(from = c("ASIAN AND PACI", 
                  "BLACK NON HISP",
                  "WHITE NON HISP"), 
         to = c("ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", 
                "BLACK NON HISPANIC",
                "WHITE NON HISPANIC"))

baby_names <-
  read_csv("./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, 
                             ethnicity == "ASIAN AND PACI", 
                             "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER"),
         ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, 
                             ethnicity == "BLACK NON HISP", 
                             "BLACK NON HISPANIC"),
         ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, 
                             ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP", 
                             "WHITE NON HISPANIC"))
```

``` r
olivia <-
  filter(baby_names, childs_first_name == "Olivia") %>% 
  select(-gender, -childs_first_name, -count) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year_of_birth, values_from = rank)
olivia
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 5
    ##   ethnicity                  `2016` `2015` `2014` `2013`
    ##   <chr>                       <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER      1      1      1      3
    ## 2 BLACK NON HISPANIC              8      4      8      6
    ## 3 HISPANIC                       13     16     16     22
    ## 4 WHITE NON HISPANIC              1      1      1      1

``` r
male_no1 <-
  filter(baby_names, gender == "MALE" & rank == 1) %>% 
  select(-gender, - count, -rank) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = year_of_birth, values_from = childs_first_name)

male_no1
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 7
    ##   ethnicity                  `2016` `2015` `2014` `2013` `2012` `2011` 
    ##   <chr>                      <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  
    ## 1 ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER Ethan  Jayden Jayden Jayden RYAN   ETHAN  
    ## 2 BLACK NON HISPANIC         Noah   Noah   Ethan  Ethan  JAYDEN JAYDEN 
    ## 3 HISPANIC                   Liam   Liam   Liam   Jayden JAYDEN JAYDEN 
    ## 4 WHITE NON HISPANIC         Joseph David  Joseph David  JOSEPH MICHAEL

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).
