## Problem 1

The following code chunk uploads the publicly available data of
Mr. Trashwheel from May 2014 through June 2019 in an Excel spreadsheet
format.

The following changes have been made to the dataset:

-   non-data entries are omitted (i.e. rows with notes/figures and
    columns containing notes),
-   reasonable variable names have been applied,
-   rows that do not include dumpster-specific data are omitted, and
-   the number of `sports_balls` is rounded to the nearest integer.

``` r
trash_wheel <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(volume_cu_yds = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) 
```

The following code chunk reads, cleans, and combines precipitation data
availble for 2018 and 2019.

``` r
precip2019 <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:B15",
                    sheet = 4)  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(precip_in = total) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.name[month], year = "2019") %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip2018 <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:B15",
                    sheet = 5)  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(precip_in = total) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.name[month], year = "2018") %>% 
  relocate(year)

all_precip <- bind_rows(precip2018, precip2019)
```

In the dataset first presented describes the trash collected by
Mr. Trashwheel from 2018 through 2019, taking in 344 dumpsters with an
average of 3.262936 tons of trash per dumpster, ulitmately collecting a
total of 1122.45 tons of trash over the course of these 18 months.

Some quick statistics on the weather conditions and trash collected:

-   <b>Precipitation</b>: Total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.
    For the first half of 2019 precipitation was 16.67 inches. A total
    of 87 inches of precipitation fell over the 18-month observation
    period noted here.

-   <b>Plastic bottles</b>: There were a over 0.64 million plastic
    bottles collected with a mean of 1873 plastic bottles per dumpster.

-   <b>Glass bottles</b>: Comparatively there were only a total of 8724
    glass bottles collected with a mean of 25.36 glass bottles per
    dumpster.

-   <b> Sports balls</b>: Per dumpster there were an average of 11.81
    sports balls collected by Mr. Trashwheel during this time. When
    broken down by years:

    -   In 2014 there were an average of 6.05 sports balls collected
        (median of 6 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 17.44 sports balls collected
        (median of 16 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 25.67 sports balls collected
        (median of 26 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 9.64 sports balls collected
        (median of 8 sports balls),
    -   In 2018 there were an average of 4.82 sports balls collected
        (median of 4 sports balls),
    -   <b>And in 2019 there were an average of 9.07 sports balls
        collected (median of 8.5 sports balls).</b>
