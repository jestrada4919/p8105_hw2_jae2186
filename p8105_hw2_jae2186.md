## Problem 1

The following code chunk uploads the publicly available data of
Mr. Trashwheel from May 2014 through January 2021 in an Excel
spreadsheet format.

The following changes have been made to the dataset:

-   non-data entries are omitted (i.e. rows with notes/figures and
    columns containing notes),
-   reasonable variable names have been applied,
-   rows that do not include dumpster-specific data are omitted, and
-   the number of `sports_balls` is rounded to the nearest integer.

``` r
trash_wheel <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:N535") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(volume_cu_yds = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) 
```

The following code chunk reads, cleans, and combines precipitation data
availble for 2018 and 2019.

``` r
precip2019 <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:B14",
                    sheet = 6)  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(precip_in = total) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.name[month], year = "2019") %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip2018 <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                    range = "A2:B14",
                    sheet = 5)  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(precip_in = total) %>% 
  mutate (month = month.name[month], year = "2018") %>% 
  relocate(year)

all_precip <- bind_rows(precip2018, precip2019)
```

The dataset first presented describes the trash collected by
Mr. Trashwheel from mid-May 2014 through January 2021, taking in 453
dumpsters with an average of 3.2002208 tons of trash per dumpster,
ultimately collecting a total of 1449.7 tons of trash over the course of
these years.

Some quick statistics on the weather conditions and trash collected:

-   <b>Precipitation</b>: Total precipitation in 2018 was 56.75 inches.
    For 2019 precipitation was 33.95 inches. A total of 90.7 inches of
    precipitation fell over the 2-year observation period noted here.

-   <b>Plastic bottles</b>: There were a over 0.86 million plastic
    bottles collected with a mean of 1899 plastic bottles per dumpster.

-   <b>Glass bottles</b>: Comparatively there were only a total of 10171
    glass bottles collected with a mean of 22.45 glass bottles per
    dumpster.

-   <b> Sports balls</b>: Per dumpster there were an average of 11.75
    sports balls collected by Mr. Trashwheel during this time. When
    broken down by years:

    -   In 2014 there were an average of 6.05 sports balls collected
        (median of 6 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 17.44 sports balls collected
        (median of 16 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 25.67 sports balls collected
        (median of 26 sports balls),
    -   In 2015 there were an average of 9.64 sports balls collected
        (median of 8 sports balls),
    -   In 2018 there were an average of 4.82 sports balls collected
        (median of 4 sports balls),
    -   <b>In 2019 there were an average of 10.03 sports balls collected
        (median of 9 sports balls),</b>
    -   And in 2020 there were an average of 11.89 sports balls
        collected (median of 12 sports balls),

## Problem 2

Using the data from FiveThirtyEight looking at political party and
economics measures,

``` r
pols_month <-
  read_csv("./pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year","month","day")) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  mutate(month = parse_number(month)) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove
prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day variable.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

Note: we could have used a date variable as a key instead of creating
year and month keys; doing so would help with some kinds of plotting,
and be a more accurate representation of the data. Date formats are
tricky, though. For more information check out the lubridate package in
the tidyverse.
